Introduction

In this project, I will augment the mock stackoverflow.com web application with an active server. This server will host all the static and dynamic resources required by the application. The server will run on the Node platform, which is convenient since we can now write JavaScript code for both the client and the server. I will also be using MongoDB as the back-end database to store data that will persist across user session and use React as the front end to render content on the browser. 

## Instructions to setup and run project
How Setup and run this project is that first you would need install Node.js package, the link to download is at the the bottom. Then you would need npm install on both client and server directory in your terminal. Make sure express/mongoose framework is installed in the server and mongodb is setup with instance mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/fake_so. Install axios in client as well. Then run both the server and client using nodemon start on client directory and nodemon server.js on server directory.
